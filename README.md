#### Live Prices for the Virtual Economy:
#### Description:
A website that keeps track of the price of virtual items (in dollars) in games by actively scraping the web.

#### Actors:

Users: Buyers, Sellers, Dedicated Sellers

Buyers are users who are looking for an item. Generally, their basic expected flow through the website is navigating to the item they want, clicking the link with the lowest price, and exiting our website to the external trade offer.

Sellers are users looking for general price checks. 

#### Functionality:

1. Users can search for an item
2. Users can compare current existing trade offers quickly and easily
3. Users can log their inventory into the website to calculate an exact value in fiat currency
4. Users can view the change in item costs in a visually stimulating way
5. Users can directly move from our website to the trade offer listed on an external site.
6. The website should detail what types of external websites are used for aggregating data, as well as detail the common trade practices.
7. The website should automatically calculate average price
8. The website should display the most popular items as quick links on the landing page.
